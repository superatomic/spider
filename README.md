# Spider Drawing with Python's `turtle`
This is a very basic script to draw a spider with Python's [`turtle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) graphics module.

The rendered drawing is used as [my profile](https://github.com/superatomic) image.

## Output

![A spider](spider.png)  <!-- Their name is Billie -->

## That's it!

Hopefully this program is useful to somebody someday. I certainly had fun writing it.
